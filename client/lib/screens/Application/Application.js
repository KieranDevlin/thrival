              Our vision is to give everyone the opportunity to share part of
              their story, a moment in their life that can impact someone who is
              stuck in the "Sea of Suck", that emotion space where one feels
              that no one understands, no one cares and that they are all alone.

              Everyone of us has stories stored within us, but their impact and
              potential to heal can not be unleashed until they are shared. If
              this makes you feel like you want to take the stage and share a
              story of your own, then we encourage you to apply to the theme
              that speaks to you the most.
