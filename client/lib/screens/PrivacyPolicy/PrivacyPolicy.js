              Credit card data in our database conforms to the Payment Card
              Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) Payment Application
              Data Security Standard (PA-DSS) v3.1 requirements from the credit
              card industry. That means we do not store data from credit card
              transactions such as Track II or CVV2/CID (the 3 or 4 digits on
              the back of the card). If stored, credit card numbers are securely
              encrypted and we ask that you never send a complete number to us
              in an email. PCI compliance means that our database and key
              internal applications have been tested for security by independent
              3rd party auditors and approved by the PCI council.
